SELECT (SUM(na_sales)/SUM(na_sales+eu_sales+jp_sales+other_sales))*100
FROM console_games

2. Extract a view of the console game titles ordered by platform name in 
ascending order and year of release in descending order.
SELECT game_name, platform,game_year
FROM console_games
ORDER BY platform ASC, game_year DESC

3. For each game title extract the first four letters of the publisher's name
SELECT game_name, SUBSTRING(publisher, 1,3)
FROM console_games

4.Display all console platforms which were released either just before black Friday
or just before Christmas
SELECT platform_name,first_retail_availability
FROM console_dates
WHERE EXTRACT (MONTH FROM first_retail_availability)=11 OR EXTRACT (MONTH FROM first_retail_availability)=12
AND EXTRACT (DAY FROM first_retail_availability) BETWEEN 15 AND 24;

5. Order the platforms by their longevity in ascending order(i.e. the platform which was available for the 
longest at the bottom)
SELECT platform_name, first_retail_availability, discontinued, AGE(discontinued,first_retail_availability) AS longevity
FROM console_dates
ORDER BY longevity ASC
